🎹 Toy Piano - Module Project IIIWelcome to the Toy Piano project repository!This project was developed by Group 15 for the Department of Electrical-Electronics Engineering at Sivas Science and Technology University.Our goal was to design and implement a simple yet functional "Toy Piano" capable of generating distinct musical tones using analog circuitry and signal processing concepts.👥 Project Team (Group 15)|| Name | ID | Role || Kaan Özkan | 230202073 | Circuit Theory, Design, Proteus Simulation || Erkut Doğan | 240201044 | Electronics Design, Circuit Setup || Furkan Hatipoğulları | 220202015 | Signals & Systems, MATLAB Analysis, Reporting |Advisor: Dr. Ass. Sıtkı AkkayaDate: 26.12.2025📖 Project OverviewIn this project, we designed a circuit to generate musical notes (Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si, Do) within one octave. The core of the system is a 555 Timer IC configured in Astable Multivibrator mode.Key Features:Tone Generation: Square-wave signal generation using a 555 Timer.Frequency Control: A resistor ladder network controlled by push buttons to change the oscillation frequency (musical notes).Amplification: A Class B Push-Pull (Complementary Symmetry) amplifier (using TIP31/TIP32 transistors) to drive the speaker.Simulation: Validated using Proteus (for circuit logic) and MATLAB (for signal analysis).🛠️ Circuit Design & Theory1. The Oscillator (555 Timer)We used the standard astable frequency formula:$$f = \frac{1.44}{(R_1 + 2R_2) \cdot C}$$C: 100nF (constant)R1: 1kΩ (constant)R2: Variable resistance determined by the button pressed.2. Frequency Table & Error RatesWe calculated the theoretical values vs. the measured values. Here is a summary of our results:| Button | Note | Theoretical Freq (Hz) | Measured Freq (Hz) | Error (%) || 1 | Fa 5 | 698 | 685.7 | 1.83% || 2 | Mi 5 | 659 | 644.0 | 2.31% || 3 | Re 5 | 587 | 571.0 | 2.78% || 4 | Do 5 | 523 | 511.0 | 2.34% || 5 | La 4 | 440 | 444.0 | 0.91% || 6 | G# 4 | 415 | 419.0 | 0.89% || 7 | F# 4 | 370 | 369.0 | 0.27% || 8 | Mi 4 | 330 | 328.0 | 0.49% |3. AmplificationSince the 555 timer cannot drive an 8Ω speaker directly with high quality, we implemented a Push-Pull Amplifier stage to act as a current buffer, ensuring the speaker operates safely.💻 SimulationsMATLAB AnalysisWe modeled the discrete-time signal and compared the oscilloscope measurements with theoretical waves.You can run the analysis using the file: toy_piano_analysis.mProteus CircuitThe circuit schematic includes:Button array for note selection.Resistor ladder.555 Timer IC.Push-pull amplifier stage.Speaker (modeled as RL load).(Screenshots of the simulations can be found in the docs/ folder or the project report).🚀 How to RunMATLAB: Open toy_piano_analysis.m in MATLAB and run it to see the waveform plots and frequency calculations.Proteus: Load the .pdsprj file (if available) to simulate the live circuit.Real Life: Assemble the circuit on a breadboard using the component values listed in the report.📄 License & DisclaimerThis project is for educational purposes as part of the Module Project III course.All rights reserved by Group 15 and Sivas Science and Technology University.
